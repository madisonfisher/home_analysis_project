            Machine Learning was used on this project to predict sets of time data as seen on the Housing Inventory 
            map and the graphs for different types of house value index. Both of these analysis used the same general set up 
            which involved setting up a dataframe using the previous data point and the difference between the current data point 
            and the previous data point to create the machine learning data set. This data set was then used to train the model.
            To then get the predicted data the last data point of the given data was used and the difference was calculated and plugged into 
            the model. This was repeated with a loop to get the predicted data sets used in this project.

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>
              The data used on this project came from <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/" style="color: #003366">Zillow's Research Data</a> that is updated normally monthly.
              Please note some data sets had missing data points or were not fully updated to current times. 
            </p>
            <h4>Rent Prices</h4>

              Text

            <h4>Housing Inventory</h4>
            <p>
              Mean and Median days houses were listed on the market was used for this data analysis. The files were transposed and formatted so that each city was
              its own column. Then each city was individually analyzed by taking the housing data and adding a column which took looked back at the previous week. Then
              a second column was added which took the difference between this new column and the week before. These process was then repeat to look 2 weeks back. After
              the dataframe was setup this data was then used in a machine learning model and then the model was used to predict the mean and median for another 6 months.
              This data was then graphed with the original data set on graphs that popup on a leaflet map after a city is selected. OpenCage Geocode 
              was used to find the latitude and longitude of the cities based on the city name. Please note the US data is on a popup in the center of the US. 
            </p>
            <h4>Sales vs. List Price</h4>
            <p>
              The graph developed for Sales vs. List price was generated using a 6 month rolling mean. The actual data points were also graphed 
              to show a comparison between the analyzed data and original data. The 6 month rolling mean is a good tool to use to smooth out 
              data while still seeing trends.
